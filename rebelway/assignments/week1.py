# SOLVE THESE QUESTIONS AND SPECIFY RUNNING TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY IN COMMENTS.

# Question 1:

# Given an array of integers and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# Example: [2,3,4,2,7] target = 10, output = [1,4]

def twoSum(nums, target):
    # your code goes here
    pass


# Time and space complexity:

# Question 2:
# Given some arrays with strings on them, find the most common longest prefix among them.
# Example: ["flower","flow","flight"] output = "fl"

def findMostCommonPrefix(arr):
    # your code goes here
    pass


# Time and space complexity:

# Question 3:
# Given an array of integers, return the indices of three numbers that add up to 0.
# example: [1, 2, -2, -1, 3] output = [0, 2, 3]

def threeSum(nums):
    # your code goes here
    pass


# Time and space complexity:

# Question 4:
# Given a singly linked list, reverse the nodes of the linked list
# Example 1: [1, 2, 3] output = [3, 2, 1]

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, next=None):

        self.next = next

        print(head.data)

middle = Node(2)
tail = Node(3)
